## This directory contains the folders categorized in terms of the three datasets used in our benchmark study. 

Each dataset folder contains the edited code scripts used for training in separate named folder in terms of the models used in the study. We refer to the original code repositories of the models and for training on a specific dataset, replace the corresponding code script with the edited code script(s) from this repository. 

### For example, if you want to train FaceXhuBERT on 3DMEAD:
- Clone the original FaceXHuBERT repository.
- Replace the original scripts with the corresponding files in `./3DMEAD/FaceXHuBERT/` 
- Note that, not all the scripts need to be replaced, only the corresponding ones that are provided in this repository.
